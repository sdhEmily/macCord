## Translucenty

<details>
<summary>Information on enabling translucency</summary>

### Check out [this issue](https://github.com/SlippingGittys-Discord-Themes/surCord/issues/42) if you use Windows. [Mica for Everyone](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone) is known to play decently, but be very spotty.

This theme supports translucency. 

### You can achieve the same look on Vencord/macOS by doing as follows:

* Go to Settings > Vencord, then toggle "Enable Translucent Window".
* If you're using Suncord scroll down and set "Window vibrancy style" to "HUD"
